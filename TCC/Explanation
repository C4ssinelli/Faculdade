  These are the AOMDV protocol codes, as implemented by NS-2. As part of my graduation project,
it was necessary to alter the original code. My project has the objective of verifying an alternative to avoid
the DoS consequences of Black Hole Attacks, a cyber attack that targets Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET).

  Firstly, a brief context: AOMDV is an ad hoc routing protocol for MANETs. Its main function is finding
the route for communication between nodes. It is a protocol based on BFS, sendo Route Request Packets to all
nearby nodes simultaneously. After discovering the route, it chooses the best path and sends the data packets

  The intention of modifications is converting AOMDC to a DFS-based protocol, not only that, it is supposed to
send packets to two routes simultaneously, avoiding the DoS of Black Hole Attacks.
